								<!-- tạo cột value -->
								<p>I create Value column to distinguish negative and positive profit rows</p>
								<pre><code>Value = IF(Orders[Profit]>=0,"Positive","Negative")</code></pre>
								
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/value_column.png" alt="" /></div>
								
					
								<!-- tạo cột days ships -->
								<p>I create Days Ship column to determine how many days it take to ship to customers. </p>
								<pre><code>Days Ship = DATEDIFF(Orders[Order Date],Orders[Ship Date],DAY)</code></pre>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/days_ship.png" alt="" /></div>
								
					


								<!-- tạo cột days ship bins -->
								<p>I create Days ship bins to draw the histogram chart to illustrate the distribution of days ship</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/days_ship_bins.png" alt="" /></div>
							
								</ul>
									</li>

									<li><b>Building dashboards and analyzing</b>
										<!-- profit -->
								<p>I build the first dashboard to explore insight about the profit.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/super_store_profit.png" alt="" /></div>
								
								<p>As we see, total profit that the business got was 2240,08K. Meanwhile, negative profit accounted for 36,12% in total. It was a significant figure so the business has to take it into consideration.
								</p>
								<p>
									The <i>Positive and Negative Profit by category</i> shows that Office Supplies brought the most Positive profit and the least Negative profit. It means that this Category was important and the business should promote it.
								</p>
								<p>The <i>Sales and Profit by Customer</i>  scatter chart shows that the majority of customers brought between 0 to 20K revenue (Sales) to the business. More than a half of them are in the 0 to 10K profit area while the rest of them brought negative profit. 

								</p>
								<p>The <i>Profit by Region</i> shows that the profit in 3 regions was quite similar.</p>
								<p>The <i>Positive and Negative Profit by city</i> 
									shows the total positive and negative profit of each city. This chart helps us find top cities that brought the best and worst profit.</p>
									
									<div class="image main">
										<img src="images/top_bottom_city_profit.png" alt="" />
										<p>Top 10 cities had the highest profit</p>
									</div>

									<div class="image main">
										<img src="images/top_bottom_city_profit.png" alt="" />

									</div>

								<!-- time -->
								<p>I build the second dashboard to explore insight about the time.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/super_store_time.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The <i>Profit by Date</i> chart shows the fluctuation of profit by date in the first 6 months in 2015. We see that profit in May and June was always above 0. Meanwhile, profit reached the lowest point and highest point in April. It shows that profit had the most fluctuation in April. It means that people shopped the most in summer.
							</p>
							<p>The <i>Sales by Month and Category</i> shows that people tended to buy Technology products in the first quarter of 2015 while Office Supplies were bought the most in April.</p>

							<p>The <i>Days ship by orders</i> chart shows that the majority of orders were shipped from 0 to 2 days, which means that the shipping system was quite productive.</p>

							<p>The <i>Days ship of negative profit</i> chart shows that the second quarter brought the most positive profit with less negative profit.</p>

							<p>The <i>Profit by Month and Category</i> chart shows that the second quarter brought the most positive profit with 
								less negative profit.</p>
								<!-- customer -->
								<p>I build the third dashboard to explore insight about the customer.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/super_store_customer.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The <i>Top 5 customer with highest profit</i> and <i>Top 5 customers with highest Negative Profit</i> will help us find the most profitable to give them special discounts to increase their loyalty and the most unprofitable customers to propose some solutions when they order high value orders to minimize the negative profit.</p>

							<p>The <i>Count of Order by Order Priority</i> shows that the proportion of customers in these groups are quite similar.</p>
							
							<p>The <i>Count of Order with Negative Profit by Ship Mode</i> shows that 3/4 of returned orders were shipped by Regular Air. It shows that this Ship Mode was not effective so the business should improve the quality of this Ship Mode.</p>

							<p>The <i>Count Customer by Customer Segment</i> shows that Corporate groups have the most customers while the percentage of customers in 4 regions is quite similar</p>
