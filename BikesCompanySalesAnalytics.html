								<!-- data modeling -->
								<ol>
									<li><b> Input:</b> This is a dataset from Microsoft which is about Internet Sales. It includes dimension and fact tables about sales, customers, products and transactions from 2019 to 2021. It can be download <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver15&tabs=ssms ">here</a></li>
									<li><b> Goal:</b> 
										<ul>
											<li>Analyze the business performance on overview customer and revenue</li>
											<li>Propose suggestions to improve the business performance</li>
									
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li><b>Result: </b> 
										<ul>
											<li><b>Problems: </b>why business stopped selling Bikes category while its revenue increased everyer from 2019-2020?</li>
											<li><b>Insights:</b>
												<br> - Businesses operate effectively when revenue increases and budget decreases over the years.
												<br>- The main market is in English-spoken countries like: the US, Europe and Australia.
												<br>- Customers are most distributed in London and Paris.
												<br>- Equal number of male and female customers.
												<br>- The best-selling model is the Mountain-200, especially around the end of the year.

											</li>
											<li><b>Suggestions:</b>
												<br>- Promote promotional activities on holidays of these countries such as Christmas, Thanksgiving or New Year.
												<br>- Promote the promotion of the Mountain-200 model at the end of the year.
											</li>
										</ul>

									<li><b>Project Duration </b>
										<ul style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
												<li>Identify business requirements and create user story based on an “email” from the sales manager</li>
												<li>Extract and clean data using SQL</li>
												<li>Building dashboard</li>

								<b>My detail project: </b>
									<ul style="list-style-type:decimal">
										<li><b>Business requirements and user story creating </b>
										<br>Assume that this is an email from a sales manager:
										<br> <i> I hope you are doing well. We need to improve our internet sales reports and want to <b>move from static reports to visual dashboards</b>. Essentially, we want to focus on <b>how much we have sold of what products</b>, to <b>which clients and how it has been over time</b>. Seeing as each sales person works on <b>different products and customers</b> it would be beneficial to be <b>able to filter</b> them also. We measure our <b>numbers against budget</b> so I added that in a spreadsheet so we can compare our value against performance. The budget is for 2021 and we usually look 2 years back in time when we do analysis of sales.</i>
										<br> Then I create a user story as below:
										<table>
											<tr>
												<td>No #</td>
												<td>As a (role)</td>
												<td>I want (request/demand)</td>
												<td>So that I (user value)</td>
												<td>Acceptance Criteria</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>1</td>
												<td>Sales manager</td>
												<td>to get a dashboard overview of internet sales</td>
												<td>can follow better which customers and products sells the best</td>
												<td>a power bi dashboard which updates data once a day</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>2</td>
												<td>Sales representatives</td>
												<td>a detailed overview of internet sales per customers</td>
												<td>can follow up my customers that buy the most and who we can sell to</td>
												<td>a power bi dashboard which allows me to filter data for each customer</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>3</td>
												<td>Sales representatives</td>
												<td>a detailed overview of internet sales per product</td>
												<td>can follow up my product that buy the most and who we can sell to</td>
												<td>a power bi dashboard which allows me to filter data for each product</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>4</td>
												<td>Sales manager</td>
												<td>a dashboard overview of internet sales</td>
												<td>follow sales over time against budget</td>
												<td>a power bi dashboard with graphs and KPIs comparing against budget</td>
											</tr>
											
										</table>
										</li>
										<li> <b>Data cleaning and extraction using SQL</b>
										<br> I use SQL to extract some necessary tables and columns from the data warehouse. You can see the way I extract data from the data warehouse in the .sql script <a href="https://github.com/nguyenngoctham02da/Internet-Sales-Dashboard-using-SQL-and-Power-BI">here</a>
									<br>	I extract fours dimension from the data warehouse:
									<br> Dimention 1: DIM_CALENDAR
									<div class="image main"><img src="images_bikes_sales/dim_calendar.png" alt="" /></div>
									Dimention 2: DIM_CUSTOMERS
									<div class="image main"><img src="images_bikes_sales/dim_customer.png" alt="" /></div>
									Dimention 1: DIM_SALES
									<div class="image main"><img src="images_bikes_sales/dim_sales.png" alt="" /></div>
									Dimention 1: DIM_PRODUCTS
									<div class="image main"><img src="images_bikes_sales/dim_product.png" alt="" /></div>
										
										</li>
										<li><b>Building a dashboard using Power BI</b>
										<br> I import all dimensions in Power BI and create relationships for them.
										<div class="image main"><img src="images_bikes_sales/relationship.png" alt="" /></div>
										<br>	I use Power BI to build a dynamic dashboard about sales overview, customers and product.
										<div class="image main"><img src="images_bikes_sales/overview.png" alt="" /></div>
										The overview dashboard shows that:
										<br> - Revenue grew and budget declined over the years which means that business operated efficiently.
										<br> - The main product is Bikes which accounted for the majority of sales in 2019 and 2020 but are no longer sold in 2021. Why is that?
										<br> - The main market is in English-spoken countries like: the US, Europe and Australia. Therefore, the business should promote promotional activities on holidays of these countries such as Christmas, Thanksgiving or New Year.
										<div class="image main"><img src="images_bikes_sales/customer.png" alt="" /></div>
										The customer dashboard shows that:
										<br> - Customers are most distributed in London and Paris
										<br> - Equal number of male and female customers
										<li><b>Conclusion</b>
											<ul>
												<li><b>Problems: </b>why business stopped selling Bikes category while its revenue increased everyer from 2019-2020?</li>
												<li><b>Insights:</b>
													<br> - Businesses operate effectively when revenue increases and budget decreases over the years.
